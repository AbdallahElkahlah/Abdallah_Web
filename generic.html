							    <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>I collaborated with a dynamic team to develop an engaging 2D Metroid game using Unity and C#. This project was a comprehensive endeavor that involved intensive project management, gameplay design, and software development practices.</p>

    <h2>Technologies and Tools Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity</li>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C#</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Jira</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Role and Responsibilities:</h2>
    <p>As a key member of the development team, I contributed significantly in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Programming:</strong> Utilized C# to implement core game mechanics, including character movement, enemy AI, and item collection systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Level Design:</strong> Designed and developed multiple levels, ensuring a challenging and enjoyable player experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics and Animation:</strong> Integrated 2D sprites and animations to bring the game world to life.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Implemented precise collision detection to enhance gameplay realism and responsiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Integration:</strong> Added background music and sound effects to improve the gameâ€™s atmosphere and player immersion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Coordination:</strong> Leveraged Jira to manage and assign tasks, ensuring efficient workflow and timely completion of project milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Organized and conducted sprint planning sessions, defining clear goals and deadlines for each development phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Tracking:</strong> Monitored and tracked bugs and issues, facilitating prompt resolution and maintaining the game's quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Coordinated with team members through Jira, maintaining clear communication and effective collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Faced challenges with game performance on lower-end devices. Optimized code and assets to ensure smooth gameplay across various platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex AI Behavior:</strong> Developed sophisticated enemy AI behaviors that presented significant challenges. Iteratively refined algorithms to create intelligent and unpredictable enemy movements.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Feedback Integration:</strong> Incorporated feedback from playtesting sessions to refine game mechanics and level design, enhancing overall player experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome:</h2>
    <p>The project culminated in a fully functional and polished 2D Metroid game that received positive feedback from peers and playtesters. This experience not only honed my technical skills in Unity and C# but also significantly improved my project management abilities and teamwork skills.</p>

    
    <h2>Play the Game:</h2>
