							<p> Project Overview:
I collaborated with a dynamic team to develop an engaging 2D Metroid game using Unity and C#. This project was a comprehensive endeavor that involved intensive project management, gameplay design, and software development practices.

<b>Technologies and Tools Used:</b>

Game Engine: Unity
Programming Language: C#
Project Management: Jira
								
<b>My Role and Responsibilities:</b>
								
As a key member of the development team, I contributed significantly in the following areas:

Gameplay Programming: Utilized C# to implement core game mechanics, including character movement, enemy AI, and item collection systems.
Level Design: Designed and developed multiple levels, ensuring a challenging and enjoyable player experience.
Graphics and Animation: Integrated 2D sprites and animations to bring the game world to life.
Collision Detection: Implemented precise collision detection to enhance gameplay realism and responsiveness.
Audio Integration: Added background music and sound effects to improve the gameâ€™s atmosphere and player immersion.
								
<b>Project Management:</b>

Task Coordination: Leveraged Jira to manage and assign tasks, ensuring efficient workflow and timely completion of project milestones.
Sprint Planning: Organized and conducted sprint planning sessions, defining clear goals and deadlines for each development phase.
Issue Tracking: Monitored and tracked bugs and issues, facilitating prompt resolution and maintaining the game's quality.
Team Collaboration: Coordinated with team members through Jira, maintaining clear communication and effective collaboration.
Challenges and Solutions:

Performance Optimization: Faced challenges with game performance on lower-end devices. Optimized code and assets to ensure smooth gameplay across various platforms.
Complex AI Behavior: Developed sophisticated enemy AI behaviors that presented significant challenges. Iteratively refined algorithms to create intelligent and unpredictable enemy movements.
Player Feedback Integration: Incorporated feedback from playtesting sessions to refine game mechanics and level design, enhancing overall player experience.
								
<b>Outcome:</b>
								
The project culminated in a fully functional and polished 2D Metroid game that received positive feedback from peers and playtesters. This experience not only honed my technical skills in Unity and C# but also significantly improved my project management abilities and teamwork skills.
