							    <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>I led a team to develop an exciting 3D Maze escape game using Unity and C#. The game challenges players to navigate through a maze, collect all coins, and avoid ghosts. This project involved robust project management practices, gameplay programming, and 3D game design.</p>

    <h2>Technologies and Tools Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity</li>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C#</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Jira</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Role and Responsibilities:</h2>
    <p>As the project leader and a key developer, I was responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Programming:</strong> Implemented core game mechanics such as player movement, coin collection, and ghost AI using C#.</li>
        <li><strong>3D Level Design:</strong> Designed intricate maze levels, ensuring a challenging and immersive player experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics and Animation:</strong> Integrated 3D models, animations, and visual effects to enhance the game’s visual appeal.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Developed accurate collision detection systems to manage interactions between the player, coins, and ghosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Integration:</strong> Added ambient sounds, background music, and sound effects to create an engaging auditory experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Coordination:</strong> Utilized Jira to manage and assign tasks, ensuring all team members were aligned and productive.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Conducted sprint planning sessions to outline goals, set deadlines, and prioritize tasks for each development phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Tracking:</strong> Monitored and resolved bugs and issues promptly to maintain the game’s quality and playability.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Facilitated effective communication and collaboration among team members through Jira and regular meetings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ghost AI Behavior:</strong> Developed complex AI for ghost characters to make their movements unpredictable and challenging for the player. Iterated on algorithms to enhance gameplay balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Maze Complexity:</strong> Created intricate maze designs that balanced difficulty with playability. Utilized playtesting feedback to refine maze layouts and improve player experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimized game performance to ensure smooth operation across various devices by refining code and reducing asset overhead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome:</h2>
    <p>The project resulted in a fully functional and polished 3D Maze escape game that received positive feedback from playtesters. This experience not only honed my skills in Unity and C# but also significantly improved my project management abilities and teamwork skills.</p>

    <h2>Play the Game:</h2>
    <ul class="actions">
	<li><a href="https://abdallah-elkahlah.itch.io/maze-madness-and-the-quest-for-the-whispering-gold" class="button scrolly">Playable version</a></li>
    </ul>	

    <h2>What I Learned:</h2>
    <p>This project was a profound learning experience that enhanced my abilities in software development, 3D game design, and project management. It strengthened my proficiency in Unity and C#, taught me the importance of efficient task management and collaboration through Jira, and underscored the value of iterative development and user feedback in creating a compelling game.</p>
